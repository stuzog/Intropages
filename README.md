# An Introduction To R
 
<img src="images/Rlogo.png" width="150" />

**This material is my own process of learning the R programming language. It can be yours, too.**

**Originally just notes on R, it grew into a series of presentations** to the [VicPiMakers Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Victoria-Raspberry-PiMakers-And-Others/) in [Victoria BC](https://www.tourismvictoria.com/) in April and May 2018. Each presentation was created in the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/) as a series of [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents that were output to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) then transferred to a Web hosting site by [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol).

**This Series has now become what I hope is a useful tool for learning R**. Instructions for setting up and using it are given in [Setup](https://r.stuzog.com/Setup.html).

Good luck with your R learning!
